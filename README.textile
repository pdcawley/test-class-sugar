h1. Test::Class::Sugar

h2. Synopsis

@Test::Class::Sugar@ is a declarative wrapper around Adrian Howard's
"@Test::Class@":http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Class xUnit style Perl
testing library.

The idea is that, instead of writing:

<pre><code>
package Test::Something;
use base qw/Test::Class/;

use Test::Most;

sub subject {
  'Something'
}

sub test_something : Test(3) {
  my $test = shift;
  is $test->current_method, 'test_something';
  is $test->subject, 'Something';
  isa_ok $test, 'Test::Something';
}
</code></pre>

You will be able to write:

<pre><code>
use Test::Class::Sugar;

testclass exercises Something {
  test something >> 3 {
    is $test->current_method, 'test_something';
    is $test->subject, 'Something';
    isa_ok $test, 'Test::Something';
  }
}
</code></pre>
